# web-training
Hey, this will be the repository with all the exercises and content you need
to get a basic understanding of key concepts in Web Applications.

### Practical exercises
This section will have 5 exercises that will grant you basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and
Javascript.

The exercises are captured from you know...so we have only images of them.

Each exercise will be in it's own directory in the repository.

### Theoretical content
I have prepared a Trello board with the materials, but now when we have a 
dedicated repository to handle all of the content, I will transfer the links 
of the videos and articles to this repository soon.
